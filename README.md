# database_project
<ul>
  <li>This project was used to evaluate our knowledge in databases and if we could use them properly/li>
  <li>I was very interested in sports and always wanted to maintain a database of information about all the athletic events happening across the globe</li>
  <li>I wanted to design a database which will be user friendly so that multiple people will be able to update the information about the athletic events they know about</li>
  <li>I used a hybrid method where i used the Djangos models.py to create the database but instead of using the ORM(Object Relational Mapper) we used Raw SQL commands because thats what the teachers wanted us to use</li>
  <li>I have used the olympic records data at present to fill the tables</li>
  <li>I have used the  python plotting library matplotlib to plot the performance of the athlete in his event,I have to find some other ways to plot the data though because I run into some background problems when i use matplotlib for plotting and showing the result as an image</li>
  <li>The effort was considerbaly more than the effort I had put for other Django projects because I was trying to figure out how to work with external databases when I was working on this project</li>
  <li>I worked with one of my friends to come up with the frontend and we used to discuss about how we wanted the website to look like and we just decided that we were gonna use simple interfaces but ultra HD images for the background.</li>
